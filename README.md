# 🛡️ Botium Toys Security Audit Project 🚀  
_Comprehensive Security Audit & Compliance Assessment for Botium Toys_

## 🧠 Summary / What It Does  
This project delivers a full-scale internal IT security audit for **Botium Toys**, a fictional e-commerce company scaling rapidly. The goal? Strengthen their security posture, support business continuity, and ensure compliance with industry regulations.

Using the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**, I analyzed infrastructure, identified key risks, evaluated control effectiveness, and delivered actionable recommendations. This project highlights my hands-on understanding of cybersecurity frameworks, risk management, and compliance strategies. 🔥
